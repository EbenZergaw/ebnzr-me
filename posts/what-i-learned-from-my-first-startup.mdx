title: What I learned from my first startup
date: November 20 2023
description: As I grew in my journey of learning martial arts, I want to give back and inspire others to do the same. I really do believe in the value of learning how to fight. It's encouraging to see beginners overcome their fears of getting hit and grow as fighters. Iâ€™ve been training in boxing and muay thai for over 2 years and I have witnessed first hand how it's helped me in my life.

Some of the best decisions I've made were completely spontaneous. No planning, no research, no well thought out analysis, just action. I've made some of my worst decisions
the same way too but thats a post for another time. 

In the 9th grade, I decided to sell candy just to see what would happen. The first day was a trial run. I had gum, mentos, and snickers.
The mentos sold first, nobody bought the gum, and I was cleverly finessed off the snickers.

The next day I brought 3 mentos bars to school and sold them within 7 minutes of stepping on campus. I figured I had a winning product.
I scaled that up and began moving thousands of calories of sugar through the student population. 

One year and thousands of Ethiopian birr later, I kept getting in trouble at the principals office. This pushed to me to figure out what I could
do off campus to get my bag up. My friends and I teamed up and began brainstorming ideas during lunch time. This lead to the birth of my first
startup: Abay Shops.

## The Market
Growing up in Addis Ababa, I saw firsthand how the digital infrastructure that is ubiquitous in developed countries is under-utilized, suboptimal,
or even non-existent in Ethiopia. One example of this is in financial technology, especially with consumers. Though now its beginning to be more well adopted, digital payments weren't a thing during my sophomore year
of highschool. Given that Ethiopia was a cash economy, transactions were completed through cash or bank transfers.

Surprisingly however, e-commerce was a thing. Sort of.

Most people have mobile phones, and one of the most popular social media apps is Telegram. 
In addition to chatting with individuals, one of its most promising features is creating channels that people could join.
This is a simple use case but it boasts great applications.

There are (even to this day) Telegram channels with well over 200,000+ users where people advertise products, services, job openings,
and content. There are dozens of these mega-sized channels for people to trade items. If you wanted to post an ad on these channels,
you would contact the admin, agree on a payment, and he would post the ad for you.
Sellers would also have a Telegram channel that would act as a digital storefront for their businesses. Fashion boutiques, electronic stores,
and various other small to medium sized businesses would use Telegram for marketing, lead generation, customer relationship management, 
order fulfillment, and various other functions.

The problem is that Telegram is not built for any of that shit. It's a social media app, not an e-commerce platform.
This problem would manifest itself in very painful ways for both buyers and sellers.

## The Problem
Having seen the potential in this space, my friends and I began customer discovery. We called hundreds of sellers we found on Telegram and asked
them about their struggles, experiences, and pain points with using Telegram. We figured that if we asked enough people about their problems, we'd be able
to figure out a solution. 

One thing that these sellers kept bringing up is how customers flake on them. The buyer would see an item they like, they'd contact the seller and arrange for
a time and place to complete the transaction, but when the time comes for them to actually buy the item, they'd ghost the seller.

When we asked sellers how often this happens, they 

To combat this, some sellers would have their customers make a down payment first. But this is an inconvenience for the buyer. I experienced
this myself when I wanted to buy a shirt but the seller told me pay up 50%. I wasn't about to walk all the way to the bank, wait in line, and deposit
money for an item I haven't received yet. Thats too much work on my part.
