Every skill can be thought of as a tool that can be used for solving different problems.
The more tools you have, the more problems you can solve.

Let us examine coding as an example. That word itself is very broad and it entails many things. But for the sake of the argument, let it be said that being able to write code allows you to build digital solutions to problems. Software development gives you the skills to build systems and products that achieve a desired outcome. If I wanted to automate a task, store and display data, or program a missile, I would use software as the means of achieving those ends. In the context of building, structuring, and developing software, coding is the tool that enables you to solve problems in that space.

While development builds the underlying structure, its design informs how it is used. UX designers deal with the problems of a product's ease of use, intuitiveness, and the satisfaction it provides a user. Graphic design specifically solves communication challenges using visual media. A graphic designer knows how to craft a poster, thumbnail or brochure. A *good graphic designer* knows how to do that to achieve a desired outcome, whether that's getting people to an event, improving conversions on a video, or making a website pretty. 

Both design and coding are tools that can be applied to solve problems. It is the nature of the problems they solve that differ. 
Knowing how to architect a system that can handle millions of concurrent users is different from knowing how to communicate its value in a visual format. Being able to do both makes you powerful.

Stacking skills is akin to expanding your toolbox. It widens your capacity for taking on problems of various natures. Being well-rounded and competent across different domains supercharges your potential for creating and capturing value. Every skill you learn is an additional dimension that you add to your thinking and character. The more you learn, the more problems you can solve.

Just as we build individual skills to solve specific problems, entire fields of study exist to solve the more complex challenges humanity faces.

Biology explores the mysteries of cellular function and the structure of life. 
Economics provides answers to the problems of resource allocation and rational decision making. 
Political science attempts to solve the problem of social cooperation and the distribution of power.
Philosophy grapples with the problems of ethics and the nature of reality. 

And Christianity deals with the problem of sin.
