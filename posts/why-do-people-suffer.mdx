In the 9th chapter of the Gospel according to John, Jesus and his disciples saw a man who was blind from birth.
His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents that he was born blind?"

Jesus said, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned, but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. 
*As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me.* 
Night is coming when no one can work."

Christ then went on to heal the man's blindness, and his eyes were opened.

This chapter holds an answer to one of life's deepest questions: why is there suffering in the world?
Many people refuse to believe in God by pointing to the undeserved suffering in the world. They see the innocent experience horrible instances of famine, disease, war, illness, and various other forms of pain, and they come to the conclusion that there is no benign presence in the universe. 

The greek materialist philosopher Epicurus took this line of reasoning a step further and posited that if there was a God then he is either not powerful enough to stop the suffering in the world, or so evil as to allow it. This essay is not a full refutation of the Epicurean paradox, but it aims at providing an alternative viewpoint to the problem of human suffering. 

Instead of seeing suffering as evidence against God’s existence or goodness, the 9th chapter of the Gospel of John invites us to view suffering as a context in which love, compassion, and healing can manifest through human action.

But this is not immediately made clear, as the disciples showed in the passage by asking if the blind man had sinned.

It is convenient to dismiss suffering as a punishment brought on to people that deserve it. If suffering is the consequence of wrongdoing, then it's easier for us to accept its existence. It is one thing if a man brings upon himself such suffering as a result of committing evil. But it is tragic for him to suffer when he has done nothing wrong.

This brings to mind the story of Job, which is probably the best answer to the problem of suffering framed from a personal point of view. While Job wrestles with the personal anguish of undeserved suffering, John 9 widens the lens to examine not just why we suffer, but how we should respond to the suffering of others.

Just as the disciples asked if the man or his parents sinned, we too look for a reason for why people suffer. 
More often than not, the search for a reason for suffering yields no returns. Perhaps the default thought process when seeing others suffer is to assume they deserved it ("that man is lazy and unproductive, of course he is homeless"). By finding a reason for blame, we don't feel bad for the man, and we can proceed without acknowledging that the world could be so merciless and dark to the innocent.

This is a cop out however. Bad things happen to good people sometimes, and it is a difficult task to find an answer for why thats the case. But Jesus points out that the reason for unearned suffering is so that the works of God may be displayed. 

So what then are the works of God? 
When Jesus speaks of the 'works of God,' He’s pointing to the acts of love, compassion, and justice that reflect divine goodness. These are not just supernatural miracles, but actions we are all called to participate in—feeding the hungry, healing the sick, and bringing comfort to the afflicted.  

Plato's theory of the Forms posits that the physical world reflects imperfect copies of perfect, eternal 'Forms'. The Forms are abstract, unchanging ideals that represent the true essence of beauty, justice, and goodness. The physical realm merely partakes of the Forms.

The 'works of God' represent our participation in the highest Form of Good. Acts of love, compassion, and justice are not just individual deeds; they are expressions of the divine that we are called to embody through our actions in the world.

Just as Jesus healed the sick, fed the poor, and comforted the distressed, so too must we follow in his footsteps.
People may suffer, but we are called to help them. Each instance of unmerited suffering is an opportunity for us to show love to those who are in pain and mourning. 

It is very easy for us to look at the suffering in the world and conclude that God is evil, apathetic, or nonexistent. But this is not a wise way of thinking. If we see people suffering, yet do nothing about it, then who are we to judge God himself for allowing it? Are we not allowing such suffering too, if we see it and do nothing? How then can we say that God is evil or apathetic to the sufferings of humanity when we too are just the same?

Perhaps God allows suffering so that we may do honorable acts. 
Ask yourself - would it not be wise to recognize that suffering is an opportunity for us to serve the highest good? 
Is it not better to do good than to say that this cosmos is absent of it? 
Would it not be noble to heal the sick and clothe the naked when we see people suffering?
Instead of making assumptions of their life choices and sins to justify their state of suffering, would it not be nobler to assist them in their need?

There will come a time when we won't be able to do so.
Jesus says that as long as it is day, we must do the works of God, for the night is coming when no one can work.
We have a limited time on earth. The window for us to appease the suffering of other human beings is very short. As long as we have air in our lungs, we have the opportunity to show love to other humans. Each day is a chance to help one another. 

And we must make use of those opportunities, because the time will come when we are no longer able to do the works of God. 

What will be your excuse on that day?
