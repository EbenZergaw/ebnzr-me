Being around smart and passionate people is like fertilizer for growth. I’ve seen myself leveling up simply by having conversations with high-caliber people. Some humans are portals of knowledge. Leveraging other peoples knowledge, insights, and ideas can speed up your rate of improvement significantly.

## Move Fast and Break Shit

Writing code is like writing fiction. There’s nothing wrong with shitty drafts. It’s the incremental improvement upon an existing body of work you built that turns into something great. Very similar with startups too. Iteration is the game. Each iteration paves the way for a better upgrade. 

In the context of code, I’ve found that building something quickly, even if its shitty, provides insights of a depth much greater than spending a long time trying to engineer a perfect solution. I don’t think you can ever truly understand something until you build it, and in the process of building it, you will find out a lot more about the nature of what it is that you’re developing. Whether its as concrete as a specific component or as abstract as the value you’re providing by the solution you’re building. 

## Slow Down

I’ve recognized that being able to take a step back from writing code to deeply think about what you’re working on

## Typescript

The developer experience of typescript sucks but I understand the value it provides. Type safety and automatic documentation are not something I’d worry about in the moment but they are definitely important and useful.

Coding in typescript feels like using a condom. 

It’s not as fun but its the responsible thing to do.

It prevents errors from growing into a massive problem that could cost a lot of time or money 9 months down the line when the application gets a lot larger and difficult to maintain.

Am at that point where I dogmatically defend Typescript like most other devs?

No.

I still fucking hate it.

But I understand that a large part of my maturity as a developer will depend on my willingness to learn and use Typescript. Though I haven’t experienced the problems that it aims to solve, I know they exist and I know I could encounter them. I understand that I’m better of learning TS and getting good at it.
