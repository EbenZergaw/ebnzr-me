## Web Still Rules

- I know a lot of founders who want to build a mobile app, but I think 9 times out of 10 they should build a web app instead. Why? My philosophy is that unless I’m going to use it every day, I’m not gonna download an app on my phone.
- Theres the friction of downloading an app that doesn’t exist with visiting a website.
- Apps have a ridiculous paretto distribution. Its a winner take all market
- Websites on the other hand, are more convenient to access, and don’t require as much commitment
- Apps are like marriage
- Websites are like dating. If I dont like you, Im never seeing you again
- We view, use, and recommend more websites than we do apps
- Websites run the world. Websites run our lives.
- And browsers are the infrastructure that allow us to not only use websites, but to interface with the internet altogether. Browsers are the foundation of the tools we use every single day.

## Role of the browser in society

- A browser is pre installed on every device
- Its open 24/7 on laptops
- Browsers are not just a product, they’re also an infrastructure, a platform, and an ecosystem

## ARC is what a browser should be

It has a very interesting philosophy as a product

Its not a revolutionary game changing innovation

It runs on chromium so the underlying technology isn’t new

But rather, it does a lot of simple things very well

The developers at the browser company truly understand the use cases, pain points, and complexities of using a browser in our day to day lives.
